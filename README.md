## INSTALLATION
There are two files (.css and .js) delivered with this plugin and that must be included in your html page after the jquery.js library and the jQuery UI style sheet (the jQuery UI javascript library is not necessary). Both of these are to be included inside of the 'head' element of the document. Example below demonstrates this along side the jQuery libraries.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
